# BA2 Manager - The Ultimate BA2 Limit Fix

**Tired of hitting the 255 BA2 limit in Fallout 4?**
**Does your game crash because you have too many mods?**

**BA2 Manager** is a modern, standalone tool designed to help you manage your Fallout 4 archives effortlessly. It takes the guesswork out of the BA2 limit and keeps your load order stable.

---

### 🛑 The Problem
Fallout 4 has a hard engine limit: it can only load around **255 BA2 archive files** (including the base game and DLCs). If you go over this limit, your game will crash, textures will vanish, or audio will break.

### ✅ The Solution
**BA2 Manager** scans your load order, counts your BA2s, and lets you safely **extract** mod archives into loose files. This lowers your BA2 count while keeping the mod active in your game. It handles everything automatically—backups, extraction, and restoration.

*   **🛡️ Safety First**: The tool automatically creates backups of every mod it touches. You can restore your original files at any time.
*   **🔗 Nexus Integration**: Includes direct links to the Nexus page for your installed mods, so you can easily check for updates or endorsements.
*   **🎨 Creation Club Manager**: Easily enable or disable Creation Club content to save even more slots.
*   **🚀 Standalone App**: No Python or complex scripts required. Just download the `.exe` and run it!
