BA2 Manager for Mod Organizer 2 - The BA2 Management Tool

____________________

Take control of your BA2 files, don't let them keep you from using those new mods that you want to try.


BA2 Manager is a modern, standalone tool designed to help you manage your Fallout 4 archives effortlessly. It takes the guesswork out of the BA2 limit and helps keep your load order stable.
____________________

### 🛑 The Problem
Fallout 4 has a hard engine limit: it can only load around 500 BA2 archive files.  If you go over this limit, your game will crash on startup or cause graphical corruption..

### ✅ The Solution
BA2 Manager scans your load order, counts your BA2s, and lets you safely extract mod archives into loose files. This lowers your BA2 count while keeping the mod active in your game. It handles everything automatically — backups, extraction, and restoration. Whether the AE update inflated your load order or that 250th gun mod pushed things too far, this will help you add more mods!

### ✨ Key Features
📊 Real-Time BA2 Counter: Instantly see how close you are to the limit. The visual "Safe/Danger" bars let you know when you need to take action.
📦 Two-Click Management: Simply check the box next to a mod and hit apply to extract it. Check it again it to restore it back to its original state.
🛡️ Safety First: The tool automatically creates backups of every mod it touches. You can restore your original files at any time.
🔗 Nexus Integration: Includes direct links to the Nexus page for your installed mods, so you can easily check for updates, or find out what mod that annoyingly named "hotfix 3" belongs to.
🎨 Creation Club Manager: Easily enable or disable Creation Club content to save even more slots. Just click the ones you aren't using and they get unflagged in Mod Organizer, and disabled like a normal mod! Want one back? Just check it again, and it will reflag it as CC content and activate it. All without going into the awful Creations storefront.
🎨 Human-Readable Creation Club Names: The CC content is all labelled by its name from the Creations Store. No more guessing which one is which in your load order.
🚀 Standalone App: No Python or complex scripts required. Just download the .exe and run it!
⚙️ Auto-Detection: Just point it at Mod Organizer 2 (or better yet, put it in you MO2 folder), and it will automatically find the Fallout 4 install it's using. It will also auto-detect the Creation Club Archive2.exe file if it's in the default location!

### 🛠️ How to Use
Install Fallout 4, the FO4 Creation Kit, and set up Mod Organizer 2 to manage it (Links in the Requirements above).
Download the latest version of BA2 Manager from the Files tab and extract it. You can place it anywhere, but inside your MO2 folder is a good spot - it will auto-detect MO2 and Fallout 4 if you do.
Run ba2-manager.exe. Make sure MO2 is not running while using it, they can step on one another and cause problems.
Go to the Settings tab and make sure your paths are correct to your MO2 Mods folder and Archive2.exe and hit save settings.
Check the BA2 Information tab to see your current count.
Go to Manage Mod BA2s, check the mods you want to extract, and click Apply Changes.
Watch your BA2 count drop and your game stability rise!

### 📋 Requirements

Fallout 4: Any version, OG, NG, AE are all fine. Sorry, no support for VR at this time.
Mod Organizer 2: Sorry, no Vortex support, this app relies heavily on the MO2 Virtual File System.

Single weapon / armor mods
Standalone quest mods
Simple retextures or replacers
Mods with few or no dependencies

⚠️ Extract with Caution
Multi‑item weapon / armor packs
Mods with optional plugins or complex FOMOD installers
Large overhaul mods

❌ Do NOT Extract
Framework / core library mods (AWKCR, Armorsmith, etc.)
Address Library, Buffout 4, and similar core functionality mods
Precombine / previs mods (e.g. Boston FPS Fix)
Any mod that many others explicitly depend on
